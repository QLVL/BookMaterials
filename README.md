This repository archives the Python and R scripts used for the different analyses of the case studies in Chapter 6, Chapter 9 and Chapter 10 published in the forthcoming monograph: Geeraerts, Dirk, Dirk Speelman, Kris Heylen, Mariana Montes, Stefano De Pascale, Karlien Franco, and Michael Lang (to appear, 2023).<i>Lexical Variation and Change: A Distributional Semantic Approach.</i> Oxford: Oxford University Press. 

This collective work reports on the framework, methods and research developed in the context of the KU Leuven project <a href="https://www.arts.kuleuven.be/ling/qlvl/projects/current/nephological-semantics">'Nephological Semantics â€“ Using token clouds for meaning detection in variationist linguistics'</a>, carried out by members of the research group Quantitative Lexicology and Variational Linguistics (QLVL). 

The repository contains subfolders per chapter:
- Chapter 6
- Chapter 9
- Chapter 10

Moreover, tutorials on how to use Python and R to conduct (novel) research in the domain of lectometry, i.e. the aggregate-level analysis of distances between 
language varieties, with and without the aid of distributional semantic methods, will be added to this repository in the near future.
