This repository archives the Python and R scripts used for the different analyses of the case studies in Chapter 6, Chapter 9 and Chapter 10 
published in the forthcoming monograph: Geeraerts, Dirk, Dirk Speelman, Kris Heylen, Mariana Montes, Stefano De Pascale, Karlien Franco, and Michael Lang (to appear, 2023).
Lexical Variation and Change: A Distributional Semantic Approach. Oxford: Oxford University Press.

The repository contains subfolders per chapter:
- Chapter 6
- Chapter 9
- Chapter 10

Moreover, tutorials on how to use Python and R to conduct (novel) research in the domain of lectometry, i.e. the aggregate-level analysis of distances between 
language varieties, with and without the aid of distributional semantic methods, will be added to this repository in the near future.
